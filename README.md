# CS161-First-Game
"Dark New World", my very first 2d sidescrolling game.
-Written in C++
-Using Win32 and GDI+

My very first game, written in a weekend for the final project in my introduction to Game Development class.

While I've come a long way from here (such as not putting game logic inside of the draw loop!),
it's always good to have a frame of reference for where you first began.
